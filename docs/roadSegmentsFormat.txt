LeftCornerX LeftCornerY Height Width isOneWay Edge1 Edge2...EdgeN



Information Needed:
    - Edge(s) it's attached to
    - Location (pixel coordinates)
        - top left corner
    - height
    - width
    - where to place vectors
        - if it's a one-way, only need one vector in the middle 
            - direction? (idk yet)
    - incoming destination and outgoing destination
        - decided to implement this as a list of vertices that the RoadSegment covers
        - this also means destination/origin vertices, even if not directly connected


How to handle shared roadSegments?
    - Road Segments should represent sections of roads - not edges
    - I will temporarily take out edge names and go from there



Order of current RoadSegments in file:
    - Top horizontal
    - Middle horizontal
    - Bottom horizontal
    - Left vertical
    - Middle vertical
    - Right vertical

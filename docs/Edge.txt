End Vertices:
    - overloaded constructors
        (1) takes string name
        (2) takes name & two end vertices (origin & dest)
    - setEnd() or setEndVertices()


** maybe don't worry about removing end vertices yet
    - primarily dealing with MVNU map
        - one static map, likely built with some sort of main function

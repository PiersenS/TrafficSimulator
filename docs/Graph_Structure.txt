Graph Functionality
- weighted
    - length
    - speed limit
- Directed
    - Represents MVNU
        - most roadways are 2-way
        - entrance/exit are 1-way
- Nodes represent Intersections


Reasons to use a header file for Graph:
    - implementing multiple graphs
    - abstraction for adjacency matrix, nodes, etc.

Adjacency Matrix:
- stored amongst nodes
- each node stores its neighbors
    - this makes graph recursive



***Use Data Structures textbook for reference
Graph, Vertex, and Edge classes were implemented with
    the recommend functions from "Data Structures and Algorithms in C++"

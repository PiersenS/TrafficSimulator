Use XML file to represent steps;
    - how to get from one intersection to another

Search for XML tag of current intersection
    - under that tag, find tag for destination intersection
    - read instructions



Each Car object will decide its own destination. 
Do do this, the car will "ask" the Graph for its destination or directions
to the decided destination. 



VERY IMPORTANT:
Imagine a linked list for path-finding with RoadSegments:
A <-> B <-> C

If the car is on C and the destination is A, simply follow the linked structure to A.
I guess this is the premise of an adjacency matrix. In the case of the K4 map, A and C would be corners, not vertices. 
How to handle this?
The above linked list may represent the vertices that a given RoadSegment spans.
(1) Check the list (which doesn't have to be linked, could be a vector -- probably want to use an iterator)
(2) If Destination vertex not found (ex. D), check the adjacency matrix. 
    - If I'm on B and need to get to D...does A or C connect to D?
    - Since both connect to D, use past vertices to determine direction
        - just came from C, so I must go A -> D
        - this is unnecessary for K4, but will be necesary for larger maps
        - okay....might be necessary for intersections on K4 and all other maps...idk
